Project 3 -- Realistic Driving Analysis
Written in Python by Eric Kearney on December 9th, 2018, with great help from
Tovio Roberts. 

The purpose of this project is to be able to automatically detect a car
accident using video footage and GPS sensor data, it should also be able to
detect pedestrians in the video footage.

Due to its large filesize, the video, "0.MOV", will not be included on my
GitHub. It can be found here:

As mentioned, Tovio Roberts provided tremendous help to me for this project.
