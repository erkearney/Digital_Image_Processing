## Professor Feng Jiang -- Fall 2018
### All images were provided by professor Jiang, unless otherwise stated

All code was written by me, unless otherwise stated, though it is worth
noting that my Python code was heavily inspired by professor Jiangs'
MatLab code.

Some of the code for exercise 2 was taken directly from Brian Faure:
